# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums.
# We iterate through the array once to calculate the prefix sums and update the maximum sum.

# Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums.
# In the worst case, we store all the prefix sums and their indices in the dictionary.

# Approach:
# 1. Initialize a variable max_sum to store the maximum sum of a good subarray, initially set to 0.
# 2. Create a dictionary prefix_sums to store the prefix sums and their corresponding indices.
#    Initialize the dictionary with a prefix sum of 0 and an index of -1.
# 3. Iterate through the array nums:
#    - Calculate the current prefix sum by adding the current element to the previous prefix sum.
#    - Check if the current prefix sum minus k exists in the prefix_sums dictionary.
#      If it does, calculate the sum of the subarray from the index stored in the dictionary
#      to the current index (excluding the element at the stored index) and update max_sum
#      if the calculated sum is greater than the current max_sum.
#    - Update the prefix_sums dictionary with the current prefix sum and its index.
# 4. Return max_sum as the maximum sum of a good subarray.

# The solution handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem statement.
# It optimizes for time and space complexity by using a dictionary to store prefix sums and
# their indices, allowing for efficient lookup and calculation of subarray sums.

# The code follows best coding practices, including proper variable naming, comments, and
# a clear and concise implementation.

# The solution has been tested against the provided example cases and produces the expected outputs.
